## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Zap Not Triggering
**Symptoms**: Files appear in Google Drive but Zapier doesn't trigger

**Solutions**:
1. **Check folder path**: Ensure Zapier is monitoring the correct folder
2. **Verify permissions**: Re-authorize Google Drive access in Zapier
3. **Test manually**: Upload a file directly to Google Drive to test
4. **Check filter**: Temporarily disable filter to see if it's blocking files

### Issue: Multiple Triggers for Same File
**Symptoms**: Getting multiple notifications for the same note

**Solutions**:
1. **Adjust debounce**: Increase `debounce_seconds` in xpad config
2. **Check Google Drive**: Ensure files aren't being modified repeatedly
3. **Add unique filter**: Use file hash in filename to prevent duplicates

### Issue: Pushcut Notifications Not Received
**Symptoms**: Zapier shows success but no iOS notification

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Pushcut app**: Ensure it's installed and logged in
2. **Verify notification settings**: Check iOS notification permissions
3. **Test Pushcut directly**: Send a test notification from Pushcut app
4. **Check automation name**: Must exactly match iOS Shortcuts automation

### Issue: File Content Not Accessible
**Symptoms**: Notification received but can't read file content in iOS

**Solutions**:
1. **Check download URL**: Verify the file download URL is correct
2. **Test file access**: Try opening the file manually in Google Drive
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure file is accessible (not private)
4. **Verify encoding**: Check file is saved as UTF-8

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Folders
To monitor multiple folders, create separate Zaps for each folder or use Zapier's "Multiple Folders" feature in paid plans.

### Custom Filtering
Add more sophisticated filters based on:
- File modification time
- File content (using Google Drive's search capabilities)
- File creator
- Specific keywords in filename

### Webhook Alternative
For advanced users, you can replace Pushcut with webhooks directly to iOS Shortcuts (requires iOS 14+):

```
ACTION: Webhooks - POST
URL: [Your iOS Shortcuts webhook URL]
Payload: {"filename": "{{File Name}}", "url": "{{File Download URL}}"}
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check Zap Health
1. **Monthly**: Review Zap history for errors
2. **Check task usage**: Monitor Zapier task consumption
3. **Test end-to-end**: Periodically verify the complete pipeline

### Update Notifications
If you change your Google Drive folder structure:
1. Update the folder path in Zapier trigger
2. Test with a new file
3. Update any hardcoded paths in your configuration

---

**Next Step**: After Zapier is working, proceed to [iOS Setup Guide](../ios/setup_guide.md) to configure the iOS Shortcuts that process these notifications.
